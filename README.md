## Description

Aim of the app is fairly simple - to help you prolong your relaxation/meditation session in case you have limited time but you feel you are getting into deep state you wish to continue.
No meditative talks, no affirmations, no gongs or outer space sounds - just you focusing on yourself with no distractions.
Set how many minutes you wish your session should last - SIGNAL and ALARM times separately (it will sum up on the top of the app). After "SIGNAL" time will pass you'll hear short gentle bell sound which indicate that your ideal time of session is on. It's gentle enough not to distract you in case you are in deep relaxation/meditative state and lets you decide if you wish to end session now or continue till "ALARM" time will get to zero. "ALARM" sound is also gentle but will fire as long as you will not switch it off manually.

It's recommended to switch on flight mode for the session so nothing will distract you but don't worry - app will also work offline!

## Technical aspects

App designed using Figma, created using JavaScript, React.JS and customized Material UI.
